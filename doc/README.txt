Text on the button will be displayed between 10ms - 2000ms saying “CLICK NOW!” and when this happens you must press the button as quickly as possible. If you press too early the game will complain and reset the timer. For each correct press of the button, the game will record your reaction time to be displayed in the statistics section.

The Gameshow Buzzer mode is for 2-4 players. This will display a selected amount of buzzers depending on the number of players and can be used to simulate gameshow buzzers for trivia games. The buzzers presses are recorded for the statistics page depending is there are two, three, or four players.

The statistics page will display the statistics for the above two game modes. Reaction statistics will display the minimum, maximum, mean of reaction times and median of 10, 100 and all reactions. The gameshow statistics will displayed the amount of times a player pressed the buzzer for each game mode. Statistics can also be emailed to yourself or someone else and cleared to have a fresh start.
